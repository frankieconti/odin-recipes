BEFORE:
This project is going to use HTML to create a basic website, with links to recipes.

AFTER:
I have completed this project. 

I had an issue uploading the project onto github. While using the live preview I found the links was not working on github, however it worked on my local machine.

After a quick google search, I found someone who asked a similar question on stack overflow. The issue was I set my relative link incorrectly. I incorrectly inculded a '/' at the begining of the file path (etc '/recipes/chickensalad.html'). I removed the '/' and the links work fine now (etc recipes/chickensalad.html).
